# 2D-vector-array
vector<vector<int>> arr basically means that you have a vector that can store vectors and that's why in push_back operation we have to write vector name i.e. push_back(row) where row is vector<int> row. One more thing to notice is that we have to declare rows by ourselves.....this operation vector<vector<int>> arr doesn't automatically creates a 2D space.
